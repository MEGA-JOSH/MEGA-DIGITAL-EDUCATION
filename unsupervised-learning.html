        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that deals with unlabeled data. The goal is to identify patterns and relationships within the data without predefined categories.</p>

        <h3>Clustering Techniques</h3>
        <p>Clustering is a common unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points. Two popular clustering algorithms are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>K-Means Clustering:</strong> This algorithm partitions the data into k clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster. It iteratively assigns data points to the nearest centroid and recalculates centroids until convergence.</li>
            <li><strong>Hierarchical Clustering:</strong> This method builds a hierarchy of clusters by either merging smaller clusters into larger ones (agglomerative) or splitting larger clusters into smaller ones (divisive).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h3>
        <p>PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a lower-dimensional space. It identifies the directions (principal components) that maximize variance, making it useful for visualizing high-dimensional data.</p>

        <h3>Anomaly Detection</h3>
        <p>Anomaly detection involves identifying rare items or events in a dataset. This is particularly useful for fraud detection, network security, and fault detection.</p>
