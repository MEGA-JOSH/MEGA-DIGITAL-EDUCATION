        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of algorithms that can analyze data, identify patterns, and make decisions.</p>

        <h3>Overview of Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>ML is widely used across various fields such as finance, healthcare, and marketing. Applications include recommendation systems, fraud detection, image recognition, and natural language processing.</p>

        <h3>Types of Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>There are three main types of ML:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> The algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning that the model learns from input-output pairs.</li>
            <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> The algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, meaning it must find patterns and relationships in the input data without guidance.</li>
            <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key ML Algorithms</h3>
        <p>Several algorithms are commonly used in ML, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> A method used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more predictors.</li>
            <li><strong>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):</strong> A classification algorithm that assigns a class to a sample based on the classes of its k nearest neighbors.</li>
            <li><strong>K-Means Clustering:</strong> An unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition data into k distinct clusters based on features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Model Evaluation</h3>
        <p>Model evaluation is crucial to ensure the performance of ML models. Key metrics include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.</li>
            <li><strong>Precision:</strong> The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.</li>
            <li><strong>Recall:</strong> The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.</li>
            <li><strong>F1 Score:</strong> The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>Build and evaluate a basic predictive model using scikit-learn.</p>

        <h2>Quiz</h2>
        <p>1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?</p>
        <p>2. Describe a real-world application of machine learning.</p>
