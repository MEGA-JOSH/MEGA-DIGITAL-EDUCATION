        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that employs neural networks with many layers (deep networks) to learn from large amounts of data. It has gained popularity due to its remarkable performance in tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.</p>

        <h3>What is Deep Learning?</h3>
        <p>Deep learning differs from traditional machine learning methods in its ability to learn features automatically from raw data without the need for extensive feature engineering. The architecture of deep learning models typically includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Input Layer:</strong> The first layer that receives the input data.</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden Layers:</strong> Intermediate layers that learn representations of the data. The number of hidden layers contributes to the "depth" of the model.</li>
            <li><strong>Output Layer:</strong> The final layer that produces the model's predictions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Neural Networks</h3>
        <p>Neural networks are the backbone of deep learning. A simple neural network consists of nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Each neuron applies a mathematical transformation to its input, using an activation function to introduce non-linearity. Common activation functions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sigmoid:</strong> Outputs a value between 0 and 1, suitable for binary classification.</li>
            <li><strong>Tanh:</strong> Outputs values between -1 and 1, improving learning in hidden layers compared to sigmoid.</li>
            <li><strong>ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):</strong> Outputs zero for negative inputs and the input value for positive inputs. It helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Training Neural Networks</h3>
        <p>Training a neural network involves feeding data through the network and adjusting weights based on the error in predictions. This process typically uses backpropagation and optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.</p>

        <h3>Introduction to TensorFlow and Keras</h3>
        <p>TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Google, providing a flexible ecosystem for building and training models. Keras is a high-level API for TensorFlow, making it easier to design and experiment with neural networks. With Keras, you can build models using simple, intuitive commands, facilitating rapid prototyping.</p>
