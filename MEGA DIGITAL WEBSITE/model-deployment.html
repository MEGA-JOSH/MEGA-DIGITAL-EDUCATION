        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>Model deployment refers to the process of making a machine learning model available for use in a production environment. It involves converting the model into a format that can be accessed and used by other applications or systems.</p>

        <h3>Model Deployment Strategies</h3>
        <p>Common deployment strategies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Batch Processing:</strong> The model processes data in batches at scheduled intervals.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Processing:</strong> The model provides predictions in real-time as data is received.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Serving Models with REST APIs</h3>
        <p>REST APIs allow models to be served over the web, enabling other applications to send requests and receive predictions. Frameworks such as Flask or FastAPI can be used to create RESTful services for machine learning models.</p>

        <h3>Monitoring and Maintaining Models</h3>
        <p>Monitoring involves tracking the performance of models in production. Key aspects include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> Regularly evaluate model accuracy and other relevant metrics.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Drift:</strong> Monitor changes in data distributions that could affect model performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Version Control for Models</h3>
        <p>Version control helps manage changes to models and ensures that the correct version is used in production. Tools like Git can be used for tracking model changes.</p>

        <h3>Best Practices for Model Documentation</h3>
        <p>Good documentation is essential for understanding and maintaining models. Key elements include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model Descriptions:</strong> Document the purpose, architecture, and performance of the model.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Instructions:</strong> Provide clear guidelines on how to use the model in production.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project</h2>
