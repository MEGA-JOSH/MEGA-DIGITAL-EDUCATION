        <h1>Introduction to Frontend Frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind)</h1>
        <p>Duration: 3 hours</p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Learn how to use frontend frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind to speed up the development process and create responsive websites with ease.</p>

        <h2>Topics Covered</h2>

        <h3>1. What are CSS Frameworks and Why Use Them?</h3>
        <p>A CSS framework is a library of pre-written CSS code that helps developers build websites quickly. Frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind offer built-in styles and components, allowing for faster development and more consistent designs.</p>

        <h3>2. Introduction to Bootstrap: Grid System, Components, and Utilities</h3>
        <p>Bootstrap is one of the most popular CSS frameworks. Its grid system allows you to create responsive layouts easily. Additionally, Bootstrap offers various components like buttons, forms, and navigation bars. Here’s an example of Bootstrap’s grid system:</p>

        <pre><code>
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">Column 1</div>
        <div class="col-md-6">Column 2</div>
    </div>
</div>
        </code></pre>

        <h3>3. Tailwind CSS: Utility-First Framework</h3>
        <p>Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework that allows you to build custom designs directly in your HTML. Instead of predefined components, Tailwind offers low-level utility classes that you can use to style elements as needed. Example:</p>

        <pre><code>
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
    Button
</button>
        </code></pre>

        <h3>4. Using Frameworks to Create Responsive Websites Quickly</h3>
        <p>Both Bootstrap and Tailwind make it easy to create responsive websites without writing all the CSS from scratch. Bootstrap provides pre-made components, while Tailwind offers flexibility with utility classes.</p>

        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>Redesign a static website using either Bootstrap or Tailwind. Focus on making the site responsive and utilizing the framework's features to speed up development.</p>
