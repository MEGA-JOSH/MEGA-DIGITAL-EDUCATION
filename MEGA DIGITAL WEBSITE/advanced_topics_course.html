        <h1>Advanced Topics in Web Development</h1>
        <p>Duration: Varies</p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Explore advanced web development concepts and techniques, including performance optimization, PWAs, TypeScript, testing, debugging, and cloud deployment.</p>

        <h2>Topics Covered</h2>

        <h3>1. Web Performance Optimization</h3>
        <p>Web performance is crucial for delivering a fast and smooth user experience. Optimizing web performance involves reducing load times, improving resource efficiency, and enhancing responsiveness.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Minification:</strong> Minimize the size of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files by removing unnecessary characters (e.g., whitespace, comments).</li>
            <li><strong>Lazy Loading:</strong> Load images, videos, and other resources only when they are needed (i.e., when they appear in the viewport).</li>
            <li><strong>Image Optimization:</strong> Compress images and use modern formats like WebP to reduce file sizes.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Delivery Network (CDN):</strong> Use CDNs to distribute static files and improve load times globally.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</h3>
        <p>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) provide a native app-like experience on the web. PWAs can work offline, send push notifications, and be installed on users' devices. Key components of PWAs include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Workers:</strong> JavaScript files that enable offline functionality by caching resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Web App Manifest:</strong> A JSON file that allows users to install the PWA on their device and defines the app’s appearance.</li>
            <li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> Send notifications to users even when they are not actively using the PWA.</li>
        </ul>

        <pre><code>
// Example: Registering a service worker in a PWA
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')
        .then(registration => console.log('Service Worker registered', registration))
        .catch(error => console.log('Service Worker registration failed', error));
}
        </code></pre>

        <h3>3. Introduction to TypeScript</h3>
        <p>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. It helps catch errors during development and improves code maintainability. TypeScript is widely used in large-scale applications and modern JavaScript frameworks.</p>

        <pre><code>
// Example: Defining types in TypeScript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}

const result = add(5, 10);
console.log(result);  // Outputs: 15
        </code></pre>

        <h3>4. Testing and Debugging</h3>
        <p>Testing is essential to ensure the reliability of web applications. There are different types of tests that developers can implement, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Common testing tools include Jest, Mocha, and Cypress.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unit Tests:</strong> Test individual functions or components in isolation.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration Tests:</strong> Test how different modules work together.</li>
            <li><strong>End-to-End Tests:</strong> Test the entire application, simulating user interactions from start to finish.</li>
        </ul>

        <pre><code>
// Example: Jest unit test in JavaScript
function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
        </code></pre>

        <h3>5. Deployment on the Cloud (AWS, Netlify, Heroku)</h3>
        <p>Once a web application is built, it needs to be deployed to a live server. Cloud platforms like AWS, Netlify, and Heroku provide easy-to-use solutions for deploying web applications.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Netlify:</strong> A platform that automates deployment for static sites and provides CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment).</li>
            <li><strong>Heroku:</strong> A platform for deploying full-stack applications, supporting Node.js, Python, Ruby, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>AWS (Amazon Web Services):</strong> A comprehensive cloud platform offering scalable infrastructure, databases, and storage services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Capstone Project (Final Assessment)</h2>
        <p>The final project for this course involves building a full-fledged web application from scratch. The application should include the following features:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Fully responsive design, ensuring that it works on both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
            <li>User authentication (registration, login, logout) with session or token-based authentication.</li>
            <li>CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB).</li>
            <li>Deployment to a live server (e.g., Netlify, Heroku, AWS).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project Examples</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A Blog Site:</strong> A website where users can register, create, edit, and delete blog posts.</li>
            <li><strong>An eCommerce Site:</strong> A website with product listings, a shopping cart, and a checkout system.</li>
        </ul>
