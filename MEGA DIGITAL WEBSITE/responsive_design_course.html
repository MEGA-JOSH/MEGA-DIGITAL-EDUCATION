        <h1>Responsive Web Design & Mobile-First Development</h1>
        <p>Duration: 4 hours</p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Learn how to make websites look great and function well across devices of all sizes, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.</p>

        <h2>Topics Covered</h2>

        <h3>1. Introduction to Responsive Web Design</h3>
        <p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) allows web pages to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, providing a consistent user experience. The goal is to ensure that your content is accessible and usable on all devices without having to create separate websites for mobile, tablet, and desktop.</p>

        <h3>2. Mobile-First Approach</h3>
        <p>The mobile-first approach is a design strategy where the website is designed initially for mobile devices and then scaled up for larger screens. This ensures that mobile users have the best experience, as mobile usage is more common than ever before.</p>

        <h3>3. Media Queries and Breakpoints</h3>
        <p>Media queries allow you to apply specific CSS rules based on device characteristics, like screen width. Breakpoints are the thresholds at which you apply new styles to ensure the design adapts at different screen sizes. For example:</p>

        <pre><code>
/* Example of a media query */
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
        background-color: lightblue;
    }
}
        </code></pre>

        <h3>4. Using CSS Grid and Flexbox for Responsive Layouts</h3>
        <p>Flexbox and CSS Grid are powerful layout systems for creating responsive designs. Flexbox is perfect for one-dimensional layouts, while CSS Grid excels in two-dimensional layouts. Both can be used to ensure that your content flows correctly on all screen sizes.</p>

        <h3>5. Testing Responsiveness with Developer Tools</h3>
        <p>Most modern browsers provide developer tools that allow you to test your websiteâ€™s responsiveness across various device resolutions. You can simulate different screen sizes and ensure that your site behaves as expected.</p>

        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>Convert an existing static website into a fully responsive one using the mobile-first approach, Flexbox, and media queries.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>This section introduced the basics of responsive design, the mobile-first approach, media queries, and how to use Flexbox and Grid for layouts. You should now be able to create websites that adapt to different devices.</p>

        <h2>Exercises</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Research real-world examples of responsive websites. Analyze their design and identify breakpoints.</li>
            <li>Create a simple webpage that adjusts layout using Flexbox at different screen sizes.</li>
