        <h2>Topics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance</li>
            <li>Probability fundamentals: distributions, events, conditional probability</li>
            <li>Inferential statistics: hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, p-values</li>

            <li>Overview of statistical tests (t-test, chi-square test, ANOVA)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. Probability, a branch of mathematics, deals with calculating the likelihood of events occurring.</p>

        <h3>Descriptive Statistics</h3>
        <p>Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the characteristics of a data set. Key measures include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mean:</strong> The average of a data set.</li>
            <li><strong>Median:</strong> The middle value when data is ordered.</li>
            <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The most frequently occurring value.</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.</li>
            <li><strong>Variance:</strong> The average of the squared differences from the mean.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Probability Fundamentals</h3>
        <p>Probability measures how likely an event is to occur, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain). It includes concepts like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Distributions:</strong> Functions that show the possible values of a variable and how often they occur.</li>
            <li><strong>Conditional Probability:</strong> The probability of an event given that another event has occurred.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Inferential Statistics</h3>
        <p>Inferential statistics allow us to make inferences about populations based on sample data. Key concepts include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hypothesis Testing:</strong> A method to test an assumption regarding a population parameter.</li>
            <li><strong>Confidence Intervals:</strong> A range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter.</li>
            <li><strong>P-values:</strong> The probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Correlation and Causation</h3>
        <p>Correlation measures the relationship between two variables, while causation implies that one variable directly affects another. It's important to distinguish between the two to avoid misleading conclusions.</p>

        <h3>Statistical Tests</h3>
        <p>Common statistical tests include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>t-test:</strong> Compares the means of two groups.</li>
            <li><strong>Chi-square test:</strong> Tests the relationship between categorical variables.</li>
            <li><strong>ANOVA:</strong> Compares means across multiple groups.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>Perform statistical analysis on a dataset and draw conclusions.</p>

        <h2>Quiz</h2>
        <p>1. What is the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics?</p>
        <p>2. Define the term "p-value."</p>
        <p>3. What is the importance of distinguishing correlation from causation?</p>
