        <h1>Introduction to Modern Frontend Frameworks (React.js)</h1>
        <p>Duration: 8 hours</p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Learn how to use React.js to build modern, dynamic, and component-based UIs.</p>

        <h2>Topics Covered</h2>

        <h3>1. Why Use React? Introduction to Single-Page Applications (SPAs)</h3>
        <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create single-page applications (SPAs) where the page dynamically updates without reloading. SPAs provide a faster and more seamless user experience.</p>

        <h3>2. Components, Props, and State</h3>
        <p>React applications are built using components. Each component is a reusable piece of code. Props are inputs passed to components, while state is the component's internal data that determines how it behaves and renders.</p>

        <pre><code>
// Example: A simple React component
function Welcome(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Welcome name="John" />
            <Welcome name="Jane" />
        </div>
    );
}
        </code></pre>

        <h3>3. React Hooks (useState, useEffect)</h3>
        <p>React Hooks allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. <code>useState</code> manages the component's state, and <code>useEffect</code> handles side effects, like data fetching.</p>

        <pre><code>
// Example: Using useState and useEffect
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    useEffect(() => {
        document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
    }, [count]);
    return (
        <div>
            <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
        </div>
    );
}
        </code></pre>

        <h3>4. Working with Forms in React</h3>
        <p>Forms in React are handled slightly differently compared to regular HTML. You manage the form data with the component's state and update the state when the user inputs data.</p>

        <pre><code>
// Example: React form with controlled components
function MyForm() {
    const [name, setName] = useState('');

    const handleChange = (event) => {
        setName(event.target.value);
    }

    const handleSubmit = (event) => {
        alert('A name was submitted: ' + name);
        event.preventDefault();
    }

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <label>
                Name:
                <input type="text" value={name} onChange={handleChange} />
            </label>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
        </form>
    );
}
        </code></pre>

        <h3>5. Introduction to React Router (Client-Side Routing)</h3>
        <p>React Router allows you to create routes in your React application, which lets you change the URL and render specific components based on the current route.</p>

        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>Build a dynamic to-do list or eCommerce product page using React.js. Implement state management and client-side routing with React Router.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In this section, you learned the basics of React.js, including components, props, state, and hooks, as well as how to build dynamic user interfaces with client-side routing using React Router.</p>

        <h2>Exercises</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a simple React app with two components: one for displaying data and another for inputting data.</li>
            <li>Build a form in React that handles form submission and stores the data in the component's state.</li>
            <li>Create a mini-project that implements React Router to switch between different views in your application.</li>
        </ul>
